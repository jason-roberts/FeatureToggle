Project Description
An antidote to source control branching sickness.

Simple library using the Feature Toggle design/release/continuous integration pattern.

Release 1.0 is now available for download http://featuretoggle.codeplex.com/releases/view/77625.

FeatureToggle is designed for ease of use:

Create a (strongly typed) toggle

public class MyAwesomeFeature : SimpleFeatureToggle {}



Add some config stuff (default is app.config / web.config):

...
<appSettings>
  <add key="FeatureToggle.MyAwesomeFeature" value="false" />
</appSettings>
...



Use the toggle:

if (!MyAwesomeFeature.FeatureEnabled)
{
   // code to disable stuff (e.g. UI buttons, etc)
}



Or in XAML:

<Button Visibility="{Binding Path=MyAwesomeFeature, Converter={StaticResource toggleVisibilityConverter} }">My Awesome Feature</Button>



Types of toggles available:

    AlwaysOffFeatureToggle
    AlwaysOnFeatureToggle
    EnabledOnOrAfterDateFeatureToggle
EnabledOnOrBeforeDateFeatureToggle
    SimpleFeatureToggle
    SqlFeatureToggle




















Version 1.0
Using the Provided Toggles.
SimpleFeatureToggle
This type of Toggle gets it's enabled value from the config file (app.config or web.config).

Create a Toggle for the feature you want to control by inheriting from SimpleFeatureToggle - there's no need to override anything:

private class SaveToPdfFeatureToggle : SimpleFeatureToggle { }



Add an entry to your AppSettings section to control the value of the SaveToPdfFeatureToggle

<appSettings>
   <add key="FeatureToggle.SaveToPdfFeatureToggle " value="true"/>
</appSettings>



Note the convention FeatureToggle.<class name>

Now you can use the Toggle in code:

var savePdfFeature= new SaveToPdfFeatureToggle();
 
if (savePdfFeature.FeatureEnabled)
   ShowSavePdfButton();
else
   HideSavePdfButton();



To disable the Toggle, just set the appSettings value to false.

AlwaysOffFeatureToggle & AlwaysOnFeatureToggle
These toggle are not configurable by config so cannot be altered at runtime.

Create a Toggle for the feature you want to control by inheriting from AlwaysOffFeatureToggle or AlwaysOnFeatureToggle - there's no need to override anything:

private class SaveToPdfFeatureToggle : AlwaysOffFeatureToggle { }



Now you can use the Toggle in code:

var savePdfFeature= new SaveToPdfFeatureToggle();
 
if (savePdfFeature.FeatureEnabled)
   ShowSavePdfButton();
else
   HideSavePdfButton();



SqlFeatureToggle
This Toggle gets it's value from a Sql Server database. You can use to turn enable a Feature from a single point when the Feature spans a number of applications, services, layers, etc.

Create a Toggle for the feature you want to control by inheriting from SqlFeatureToggle- there's no need to override anything:

private class SaveToPdfFeatureToggle : SqlFeatureToggle{ }




Add an entries to your AppSettings section for the Sql Server database connection string and a sql staetment that returns either "true" or "false".

<add key="FeatureToggle.SaveToPdfFeatureToggle.ConnectionString" value="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=FeatureToggleDatabase;Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False"/>
<add key="FeatureToggle.SaveToPdfFeatureToggle.SqlStatement" value="select Value from Toggle where ToggleName = 'SaveToPdfFeatureToggle '"/>


WPF and Windows Phone 7
Binding the Visibility of a UI element to a Toggle
Create a Toggle as described above.

In your XAML declare a converter:

<Wpf:FeatureToggleToVisibilityConverter x:Key="toggleVisibilityConverter"/>



Create a property in your view-model or code-behind:

public IFeatureToggle SaveToPdfFeature
{
   get 
   {
      return _saveToPdfFeature;
   }
   set
   {
      _saveToPdfFeature = value;
      // Do INotifyPropertyChanged stuff here if required
   }
}



Now bind your UI elements visibility:

<Button Visibility="{Binding Path=SaveToPdfFeature, Converter={StaticResource toggleVisibilityConverter} }">Save To PDF</Button>


Windows Phone 7 SimpleFeatureToggle Provider
As WP7 does not have the concept of an app.config, a WindowsPhone7ApplicationResourcesSettingsProvider is used to determine a Toggle's value.

Declare a toggle as defined in the examples above, but before using you must add to the applications resources, e.g.

Application.Current.Resources.Add("SaveToPdfFeatureToggle", false);



This adds the Toggle and sets it's value to false. You could implement your own code here to retrieve the value from a file in Isolated Storage for example.
Creating Your Own Custom Toggles
Just implement IFeatureToggle and provide an implementation for FeatureEnabled - easy :)
Creating Your Own Providers
For the SimpleFeatureToggle and SqlFeatureToggle, create a class that implements IBooleanToggleValueProvider and after you instantiate your Toggle set it's BooleanToggleValueProvider property to you custom provider.
